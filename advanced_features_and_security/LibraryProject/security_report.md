# Security Review and Implementation Report

This report details the security measures implemented in the Django project to enhance protection against common web vulnerabilities.

## HTTPS and Secure Redirects

- **HTTPS Enforcement**: The `SECURE_SSL_REDIRECT` setting is enabled to ensure all traffic is encrypted.
- **HSTS Policy**: HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) is configured with `SECURE_HSTS_SECONDS`, `SECURE_HSTS_INCLUDE_SUBDOMAINS`, and `SECURE_HSTS_PRELOAD` to enforce secure connections for a defined period.

## Secure Cookies and Headers

- **Secure Cookies**: `SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE` and `CSRF_COOKIE_SECURE` are set to `True`, ensuring that cookies are only sent over secure HTTPS connections.
- **Secure Headers**: Headers such as `X_FRAME_OPTIONS='DENY'` (clickjacking) and `SECURE_CONTENT_TYPE_NOSNIFF=True` (MIME-sniffing) are configured to provide additional browser-side protection.
