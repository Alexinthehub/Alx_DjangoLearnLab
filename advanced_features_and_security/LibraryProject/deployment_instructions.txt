# Web Server Configuration for HTTPS

To serve the Django application over HTTPS, a web server (such as Nginx or Apache) must be configured with an SSL/TLS certificate.

## Nginx Example Configuration

server {
    listen 443 ssl;
    server_name your_domain.com www.your_domain.com;

    ssl_certificate /path/to/your/certificate.pem;
    ssl_certificate_key /path/to/your/private.key;

    # HSTS Header
    add_header Strict-Transport-Security "max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains; preload";

    location / {
        # Proxy pass to Django application
    }
}
